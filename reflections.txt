You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Didn't learn any new skills at this point. This was a pretty basic project so it was all easy. No challenges so far so I didn't need to fall back on any strategies.
